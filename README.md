# Titan RUR Dataset

Titan was the flagship supercomputer at the Oak
Ridge Leadership Computing Facility (OLCF). It was deployed
in late 2012, became the fastest supercomputer in the world and
was retired on August 2, 2019.

During its production lifetime, Titan provided more than
26 billion core hours of computing time to scientists. Throughout
this period, an extensive operational dataset - called the
Resource Utilization Report (RUR) - was collected from the
Titan system. This RUR data, on one hand, is extremely
coarse-grained: in order to avoid any noticeable disturbance
to the production jobs, only a small amount of data could
be collected and stored. On the other hand, the RUR data
is extremely comprehensive in the sense that it provides a
log record for every job submitted to Titan from April 2015
to July 2019. These records provide a unique window into
operational resource usage at an extreme scale and over a long
term.
